The Ranking system determines the order in which content appears in the feed. This page explains how ranking works and how you can control it through editorial overrides.

## How feed ranking works

ShortKit uses **reverse-chronological order** as the base ranking for all feed content. The most recently created content appears first, followed by older content in descending order.

On top of this base order, you can apply two editorial controls:

| Control | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Pinning** (`pinPosition`) | Forces a content item to a specific position in the feed, regardless of its creation date |
| **Suppression** (`isSuppressed`) | Removes a content item from the feed entirely without archiving it |

Content must also satisfy scheduling constraints to appear in the feed:

- `publishAt` -- if set, content only appears after this time
- `expiresAt` -- if set, content is excluded after this time
- Status must be `ready` (not `waiting_for_upload`, `processing`, `error`, or `archived`)

## Feed ordering logic

When the SDK requests the feed via `GET /v1/feed`, the server applies the following logic:

1. **Filter** -- exclude content that is suppressed, not yet published, expired, or not in `ready` status
2. **Pin** -- content with a `pinPosition` is placed at that position in the feed
3. **Order** -- all remaining content is ordered by creation time, newest first
4. **Paginate** -- return the requested page using cursor-based pagination

Pinned items always appear at their specified positions. If two items are pinned to the same position, the more recently pinned item takes priority.

## Pinning content

Pin a content item to a specific position in the feed. Position `1` is the first item the user sees.

### Pin via Content API

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/content/sk_content_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pinPosition": 1
  }'
```

### Unpin

Set `pinPosition` to `null` to remove the pin and return the item to its chronological position:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/content/sk_content_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pinPosition": null
  }'
```

### Pin multiple items

Use the [Bulk operations API](/api/bulk-operations) to pin or unpin multiple items at once:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/content/bulk/update \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "items": [
      { "id": "sk_content_abc123", "pinPosition": 1 },
      { "id": "sk_content_def456", "pinPosition": 3 },
      { "id": "sk_content_ghi789", "pinPosition": 5 }
    ]
  }'
```

## Suppressing content

Suppress a content item to hide it from the feed without archiving it. Suppressed content retains its metadata and analytics, and can be restored at any time.

### Suppress via Content API

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/content/sk_content_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "isSuppressed": true
  }'
```

### Unsuppress

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/content/sk_content_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "isSuppressed": false
  }'
```

### Suppress in bulk

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/content/bulk/update \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "items": [
      { "id": "sk_content_abc123", "isSuppressed": true },
      { "id": "sk_content_def456", "isSuppressed": true }
    ]
  }'
```

## Scheduling

Control when content appears in the feed using `publishAt` and `expiresAt` timestamps:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/content/sk_content_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "publishAt": "2026-02-10T09:00:00Z",
    "expiresAt": "2026-02-17T09:00:00Z"
  }'
```

Content with a `publishAt` in the future will not appear in the feed until that time. Content with an `expiresAt` in the past is automatically excluded.

## Example: Curated feed

Combine pinning, suppression, and scheduling to fully curate the feed:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/content/bulk/update \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "items": [
      {
        "id": "sk_content_breaking",
        "pinPosition": 1
      },
      {
        "id": "sk_content_promo",
        "pinPosition": 3,
        "expiresAt": "2026-02-14T00:00:00Z"
      },
      {
        "id": "sk_content_outdated",
        "isSuppressed": true
      }
    ]
  }'
```

This produces a feed where:
- The breaking news item always appears first
- The promotional item appears at position 3 until February 14
- The outdated item is hidden from the feed
- All other content fills remaining positions in reverse-chronological order

## Future: Signal-weighted ranking

A future release will add signal-weighted ranking that incorporates engagement signals (completion rate, watch time, likes) into the feed order. When available, you will be able to configure signal weights to control how much each factor influences content position.

The editorial controls described on this page (pinning, suppression, scheduling) will continue to work alongside signal-weighted ranking, with editorial overrides always taking priority.
