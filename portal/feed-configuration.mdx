The Feed Configuration section lets you control how content is ranked, filtered, and displayed to users.

## Ranking weights

Configure the relative importance of each ranking signal at **Feed → Ranking**.

### Weight sliders

Adjust weights for each signal (must sum to 100%):

| Signal | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Recency** | Favor newer content | 25% |
| **Engagement** | Favor popular content | 25% |
| **Geo-relevance** | Match user location | 15% |
| **Topic affinity** | Match user interests | 20% |
| **Completion rate** | Favor content users finish | 15% |

### Advanced settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Recency decay">
    Configure how quickly recency score decays:

    - **Half-life**: Hours until 50% decay (default: 72 hours)
    - **Max age**: Hard cutoff for content age

    Example: With 48-hour half-life, content from 2 days ago has 50% recency score.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Minimum thresholds">
    Set minimum engagement levels:

    - **Min views**: Exclude content with fewer views
    - **Min completion rate**: Exclude poorly-performing content

    Useful for filtering out content that's not resonating with users.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Diversity settings">
    Prevent feed repetition:

    - **Topic diversity**: Avoid consecutive items with same tag
    - **Source diversity**: Spread content from different sources
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Preview changes

Before applying weight changes:

1. Click **Preview**
2. Select a sample user profile (or use anonymous)
3. See how the feed would look with new weights
4. Compare side-by-side with current weights

## Content filters

Create named filters at **Feed → Filters**.

### Creating a filter

1. Click **Create Filter**
2. Enter filter name and slug (e.g., "Sports", "sports")
3. Define conditions:

```
Tags: ANY OF ["sports", "athletics", "nfl", "nba"]
AND
Duration: GREATER THAN 15 seconds
AND
Age: LESS THAN 7 days
```

### Filter conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Tags (ANY OF)** | Content has at least one matching tag |
| **Tags (ALL OF)** | Content has all specified tags |
| **Tags (NONE OF)** | Content has none of specified tags |
| **Duration** | Video length range |
| **Age** | Days since publish |
| **Geo** | Content geo-targeting |
| **Custom metadata** | Match custom field values |

### Using filters

Filters power:
- **Adjacent feeds**: User swipes left/right to filtered content
- **SDK filter parameter**: Request specific content subset
- **API requests**: Filter feed endpoint results

## Heuristic rules

Define hard rules at **Feed → Ranking → Rules**.

### Creating rules

Rules are evaluated before scoring:

```json
{
  "name": "Exclude old content",
  "condition": "content.ageInDays > 30",
  "action": "exclude",
  "priority": 1
}
```

### Rule builder

Use the visual rule builder:

1. Click **Add Rule**
2. Set condition using dropdowns:
   - **If** [content.tags] **contains** ["opinion"]
   - **AND** [feed.name] **equals** ["main"]
   - **Then** [exclude]
3. Set priority (lower = evaluated first)
4. Save rule

### Common rules

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Age-based exclusion">
    ```
    IF content.ageInDays > 30
    THEN exclude
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Geo-boosting">
    ```
    IF user.region == "MN"
    AND content.tags CONTAINS "minnesota"
    THEN boost 2.0x
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Category exclusion">
    ```
    IF content.tags CONTAINS "crime"
    AND feed.filter NOT CONTAINS "crime"
    THEN exclude
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Breaking news boost">
    ```
    IF content.tags CONTAINS "breaking"
    AND content.ageInHours < 4
    THEN boost 3.0x
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
