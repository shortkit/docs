The Feed Configuration section lets you manage the remote config overlay for your organization. The overlay is a server-side configuration that overrides the SDK's local defaults, giving you control over feed behavior, appearance, and controls without requiring an app update.

## Remote config overlays

When the SDK initializes, it fetches a config overlay from the ShortKit API. The overlay is a sparse JSON object -- it only contains the fields you want to override. Any field not present in the overlay keeps its SDK default value.

### How overlays work

1. The SDK ships with built-in default values for all configuration options
2. On launch, the SDK requests the config overlay from the API (`GET /v1/config`)
3. The server returns the overlay set for your organization
4. The SDK merges the overlay on top of its defaults -- overlay values win

This means you can change feed behavior for all your users from the portal without shipping an app update.

### Editing the overlay

1. Go to **Feed > Configuration**
2. Edit any configuration section (controls, theme, layout, captions, ads, etc.)
3. Changes are reflected in the overlay
4. Click **Save** to publish the overlay
5. The SDK picks up the new overlay on its next config fetch

### Configuration sections

The overlay can include settings for any section of the SDK configuration:

| Section | What it controls |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Controls** | Which playback controls are visible (scrubber, captions toggle, share button, mute button) |
| **Theme** | Colors, fonts, and visual styling of the feed UI |
| **Layout** | Feed height (fullscreen vs. partial), orientation |
| **Captions** | Default caption state (on/off), styling |
| **Playback** | Autoplay, looping, mute-on-start behavior |
| **Prefetch** | How many videos to buffer ahead |

<Tip>
  Only set the values you want to override. Omitting a field from the overlay means the SDK uses its built-in default, which keeps your configuration clean and easy to manage.
</Tip>

### Example overlay

A minimal overlay that hides the scrubber and sets a custom primary color:

```json
{
  "controls": {
    "scrubber": false
  },
  "theme": {
    "primaryColor": "#FF5733"
  }
}
```

## Feed ordering controls

The default feed ordering is reverse-chronological -- newest content appears first. You can override this ordering per content item using editorial controls.

### Pin positions

Pin content to a specific position in the feed:

1. Go to **Content > Library** and select a content item, or use **Feed > Configuration > Pinned Content**
2. Enable **Pin**
3. Set position (1 = top of feed, 2 = second position, etc.)

Pinned items always appear at their assigned position. Unpinned content fills the remaining positions in reverse-chronological order.

### Suppression

Suppress content to exclude it from the feed without archiving:

1. Select a content item
2. Enable **Suppress** in the **Editorial** tab
3. Content is excluded from feed responses

Suppressed content remains in your library and can be un-suppressed at any time. See [Content management > Editorial controls](/portal/content-management#editorial-controls) for details.

### Active overrides

View all content with active editorial overrides at **Feed > Configuration > Active Overrides**:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Content** | Title and thumbnail |
| **Type** | Pin or Suppress |
| **Value** | Pin position (for pinned items) |
| **Set by** | Who created the override |

## Advanced settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Content scheduling">
    Control when content enters and leaves the feed using `publish_at` and `expires_at` fields on individual content items.

    - **publish_at**: Content is held back from the feed until this date/time
    - **expires_at**: Content is automatically archived after this date/time

    Both fields are set per content item in the Content Library. See [Content management > Schedule](/portal/content-management#schedule) for details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Overlay versioning">
    Every change to the remote config overlay is versioned. You can view previous versions at **Feed > Configuration > History** and restore a previous version if needed.

    | Column | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | **Version** | Auto-incremented version number |
    | **Changed** | What was modified |
    | **By** | Who made the change |
    | **When** | Timestamp |

    To restore a previous version:
    1. Find the version to restore
    2. Click **Preview** to review the configuration
    3. Click **Restore** to apply it
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Per-environment overlays">
    You can maintain separate overlays for your live and test environments. The overlay served depends on which API key the SDK uses:

    - `pk_live_` keys receive the production overlay
    - `pk_test_` keys receive the test overlay

    This lets you test configuration changes in your test environment before applying them to production.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Feed preview

Test your configuration before publishing at **Feed > Preview**.

### Preview options

1. **User type**: Select from:
   - Anonymous (new user)
   - Specific user ID

2. **Config version**: Compare current production overlay vs. draft changes

### Compare mode

Compare two configurations side-by-side:

1. Left: Current production overlay
2. Right: Draft or modified overlay

See how changes affect feed content and ordering for the same user.

## A/B testing configurations

Test overlay changes with controlled experiments:

1. Go to **Experiments > Create New**
2. Define variants with different overlay values
3. Set traffic allocation
4. Run the experiment and compare engagement metrics

Each variant is a separate config overlay delivered to its assigned user segment. See [A/B testing](/portal/ab-testing) for details.
