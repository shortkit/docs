The Analytics section provides insights into how users engage with your video content. All analytics are powered by the engagement events that the SDK collects and sends to the ShortKit API automatically.

## Engagement event types

The SDK tracks 11 event types that drive all analytics in the portal:

| Event | Trigger | Key data |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `feedEntry` | Feed view appears on screen | Entry point, timestamp |
| `feedExit` | Feed view disappears or app backgrounds | Total session time, videos watched |
| `impression` | Video cell snaps into view | Content ID, position in feed |
| `playStart` | First frame of video renders | Content ID, startup time (ms), initial rendition |
| `watchProgress` | Every 1 second of continuous playback | Content ID, current time, percent complete, current bitrate |
| `completion` | Video reaches end | Content ID, total watch time, loop count |
| `swipe` | User swipes to next or previous video | From/to content ID, watch time on previous, direction |
| `rebuffer` | Playback stalls waiting for data | Content ID, rebuffer duration (ms), network type |
| `qualityChange` | Adaptive bitrate switches rendition | Content ID, from/to rendition |
| `error` | Playback error occurs | Content ID, error code, error type, device info |
| `interaction` | User taps a control (share, mute, captions, etc.) | Content ID, interaction type |

These events are collected by the SDK, batched every 30 seconds, and sent to the API. The analytics dashboard aggregates them into the metrics described below.

## Overview dashboard

Access at **Analytics > Overview** for high-level metrics across a configurable time range:

### Key metrics

| Metric | Description | Derived from |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Total views** | Number of video impressions | `impression` events |
| **Unique viewers** | Distinct users who watched content | User IDs across all events |
| **Total watch time** | Cumulative seconds of video watched | `watchProgress` events |
| **Avg. session duration** | Average time spent in the feed per visit | `feedEntry` / `feedExit` pairs |
| **Feed depth** | Average videos watched per session | `swipe` and `impression` events per session |
| **Completion rate** | Percentage of videos watched to end | `completion` events / `playStart` events |

### Trends

- Line charts showing metrics over time
- Compare to previous period
- Identify growth or decline patterns

### Top content

Most-viewed content in the selected period:
- Thumbnail and title
- View count
- Watch time
- Completion rate

## Content performance

Detailed per-content analytics at **Analytics > Content Performance**.

### Content table

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Content** | Thumbnail and title |
| **Views** | Total impressions |
| **Unique viewers** | Distinct viewers |
| **Watch time** | Total seconds watched |
| **Avg. watch time** | Seconds per view |
| **Completion rate** | Percentage watched to end |
| **Shares** | Share button taps (from `interaction` events) |

### Sorting and filtering

- Sort by any column
- Filter by tags, status, date range
- Search by title

### Content detail

Click any content item for deeper metrics:

- **Engagement over time**: Views and watch time by day/hour
- **Retention curve**: Drop-off points within the video (derived from `watchProgress` events)
- **Audience breakdown**: Device type, geography
- **Discovery**: How users found this content (feed position from `impression` events)

## Playback quality

Monitor technical performance at **Analytics > Playback Quality**. These metrics are derived from `playStart`, `rebuffer`, `qualityChange`, and `error` events.

### Quality metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Video startup time (p50)** | Median time to first frame | Less than 500ms |
| **Video startup time (p95)** | 95th percentile startup time | Less than 2s |
| **Rebuffer rate** | Percentage of views with rebuffering | Less than 2% |
| **Avg. rebuffer duration** | Average seconds spent buffering per rebuffer event | Less than 1s |
| **Avg. bitrate** | Weighted average kbps delivered | -- |
| **Quality downgrades** | Adaptive bitrate switches to lower quality | -- |

### Breakdown views

Filter quality metrics by:
- **Device type**: iPhone model, iOS version
- **Network type**: WiFi, cellular
- **Geography**: By country or region
- **Content**: Specific videos or tags

### Error tracking

View playback errors (from `error` events):

| Error type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Network** | Connection failures, timeouts |
| **Decode** | Codec issues, corrupt segments |
| **Player** | Internal player errors |

For each error type:
- Error rate trend over time
- Top affected content
- Device and geography breakdown

## Audience insights

Understand your viewers at **Analytics > Audience**.

### Demographics

- **Geography**: Map showing viewer distribution
- **Device**: Device models and OS versions
- **SDK version**: SDK versions in use across your user base

### Behavior patterns

- **Peak usage**: Hours with the most activity
- **Session frequency**: How often users return
- **Viewing patterns**: Content preferences by time of day

### Cohort analysis

Track retention by first-use date:

| Cohort | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Jan 1-7 | 100% | 45% | 32% | 28% |
| Jan 8-14 | 100% | 48% | 35% | -- |
| Jan 15-21 | 100% | 52% | -- | -- |
