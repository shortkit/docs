The Ads section of the Admin Portal lets you enable or disable in-feed video ads, configure placement rules, and monitor ad performance metrics.

## Enabling and disabling ads

Toggle ads for your organization under **Settings > Ads**.

- **Enabled** -- The feed API inserts `ad_slot` items between content items based on your configuration. The SDK loads and renders ads through the configured ad provider.
- **Disabled** -- No ad slots are inserted into the feed. The feed behaves identically to a feed without ads configured. This is the default state.

<Note>
  Disabling ads takes effect immediately. Any ad slots already delivered in a feed response will still be rendered by the SDK for that session, but no new ad slots will be included in subsequent feed requests.
</Note>

## Configuration

Configure ad placement rules and ad provider settings under **Settings > Ads > Configuration**.

### Placement rules

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Frequency** | Insert an ad slot every N content items. | 5 |
| **First ad offset** | Minimum number of content items before the first ad appears. The feed never leads with an ad. | 3 |
| **Max per page** | Maximum number of ad slots per feed page. Prevents ad-heavy pages when using large page sizes. | 3 |

### Ad provider settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **VAST tag URL** | Default VAST tag URL passed to the SDK's ad provider for ad requests. Used by providers like Google IMA. |
| **Ad unit ID** | Default ad unit identifier. An alternative to the VAST tag URL for providers that use unit-based lookups. |

You can set both values. The SDK's ad provider determines which one to use based on its implementation. The Google IMA adapter uses the VAST tag URL by default and falls back to the ad unit ID.

### Skip policy

Control whether users can skip ads.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Non-skippable** | The user cannot skip the ad. The swipe gesture is disabled for the duration of the ad. |
| **Skippable after delay** | The user can skip the ad after a configurable delay. A countdown is displayed ("Skip in 5... 4... 3..."). |
| **Always skippable** | The user can swipe past the ad at any time. |

When using **Skippable after delay**, configure the **skip delay** in seconds. The default is 5 seconds.

### Default targeting

Set default key-value targeting pairs that are included in every ad slot. These are passed to the ad provider for ad selection.

1. Go to **Settings > Ads > Configuration > Targeting**
2. Add key-value pairs (e.g., `app_section: news`, `tier: premium`)
3. Save changes

These defaults apply to all ad slots. Content-specific targeting (such as category tags from content metadata) is merged with these defaults automatically by the server.

## Ad performance

Monitor ad metrics at **Analytics > Ads**.

### Key metrics

The analytics dashboard derives ad performance metrics from the ad engagement events collected by the SDK:

| Metric | Description | Derived from |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Fill rate** | Percentage of ad requests that were filled by the ad provider | `adRequest` events (`filled` field) |
| **Impressions** | Number of ads that rendered and became visible to the user | `adImpression` events |
| **Completion rate** | Percentage of rendered ads that played to the end without being skipped | `adComplete` events vs. `adImpression` events |
| **Skip rate** | Percentage of rendered ads that were skipped by the user | `adSkip` events vs. `adImpression` events |
| **Quartile progression** | Percentage of ads reaching each quartile (25%, 50%, 75%) | `adProgress` events |

### Dashboard views

- **Overview**: Summary metrics and trends over time
- **By date**: Daily breakdown of all ad metrics
- **By content**: Which content generates the most ad impressions
- **By geography**: Metrics broken down by region
- **By device**: Breakdown by device type and OS version

### Filters

Filter performance data by:
- Date range
- Ad unit
- Device type
- Geography
- Content tags

## Ad troubleshooting

### Low fill rate

If fill rate is below expected:

1. Verify your VAST tag URL or ad unit ID is correct under **Settings > Ads > Configuration**
2. Check that geographic targeting matches your audience
3. Review the `adRequest` events in **Analytics > Ads** for common `errorReason` values
4. Contact your ad operations team or ad network support

### Ads not appearing

If ads are not showing in the feed:

1. Confirm ads are **Enabled** under **Settings > Ads**
2. Check frequency and first ad offset settings -- the user may not have scrolled far enough
3. Verify the SDK is initialized with an `adProvider` (ads require both server-side configuration and a client-side ad provider)
4. Check for ad blockers in your test environment
5. Review the debug logs in **Analytics > Ads > Debug** for request and fill status

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start conservative with frequency">
    Begin with a frequency of 6-8 content items between ads and a first ad offset of at least 3. Increase ad density gradually while monitoring session length and return rates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor retention alongside ad metrics">
    Watch session length and return rates in **Analytics**. If they drop after increasing ad frequency, reduce the density. Ad revenue is only sustainable if users keep coming back.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use skippable ads">
    Skippable-after-delay ads strike a balance between viewability and user experience. A 5-second skip delay is a common starting point.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test with experiments">
    Use A/B testing to find the optimal ad frequency for your audience before committing to a change. See [A/B testing](/portal/ab-testing) for details.
