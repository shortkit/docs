The Settings section lets you manage API credentials, configure webhooks, invite team members, and update organization settings.

## API keys

Manage API credentials at **Settings > API Keys**.

### Key types

ShortKit uses two types of API keys, each with a distinct prefix that identifies the key type and environment:

| Type | Prefix | Usage | Security |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| **Publishable key** | `pk_live_` or `pk_test_` | SDK initialization, included in client-side code | Safe to embed in your app |
| **Secret key** | `sk_live_` or `sk_test_` | Server-side API calls, content management, analytics export | Never expose publicly |

### Environments

Keys are scoped to an environment. The prefix makes the environment explicit:

| Environment | Publishable key | Secret key |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **Live** | `pk_live_...` | `sk_live_...` |
| **Test** | `pk_test_...` | `sk_test_...` |

Live keys access your production content and configuration. Test keys access a separate test environment, so you can develop and test without affecting your production feed.

### Creating keys

1. Go to **Settings > API Keys**
2. Click **Create Key Pair**
3. Select environment (live or test)
4. Optionally add a description (e.g., "iOS production" or "staging server")
5. Copy both keys

<Warning>
  Secret keys are shown only once at creation time. Store them securely in your environment variables or secrets manager. If you lose a secret key, you will need to create a new key pair and rotate the old one.
</Warning>

### Rotating keys

To rotate a compromised or expired key:

1. Create a new key pair for the same environment
2. Update your applications with the new keys
3. Verify your applications are working with the new keys
4. Delete the old key pair

### Key management

View all active keys at **Settings > API Keys**:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Description** | Label you assigned at creation |
| **Type** | Publishable or Secret |
| **Environment** | Live or Test |
| **Prefix** | First characters of the key (e.g., `pk_live_abc...`) |
| **Created** | When the key was created |
| **Last used** | Most recent API request using this key |

You can delete any key pair. Deleting a key immediately revokes access for any application using it.

## Webhooks

Configure event notifications at **Settings > Webhooks**. Webhooks let your server receive real-time notifications when events occur in ShortKit.

### Creating a webhook

1. Click **Add Webhook**
2. Enter your endpoint URL (must be HTTPS)
3. Select the events you want to receive
4. Save

### Available events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `content.ready` | Content has finished processing and is available for playback |
| `content.errored` | Content processing failed |
| `content.archived` | Content was archived (manually or via `expires_at`) |

### Webhook payload format

Events are sent as POST requests to your endpoint:

```json
{
  "event": "content.ready",
  "data": {
    "contentId": "sk_content_abc123",
    "title": "My Video",
    "duration": 45.2,
    "status": "ready"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-02-04T12:00:00Z",
  "webhookId": "whk_xyz789"
}
```

### Signature verification

Every webhook request includes a signature header so you can verify it came from ShortKit:

```
X-ShortKit-Signature: sha256=abc123...
```

Verify the signature in your code:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');

  return `sha256=${expected}` === signature;
}
```

### Webhook signing secret

Each webhook endpoint has a unique signing secret:

1. Go to **Settings > Webhooks**
2. Click on a webhook
3. Copy the **Signing Secret**

Store this secret securely on your server. Use it to verify incoming webhook signatures.

### Testing webhooks

Send a test event to verify your endpoint:

1. Go to webhook detail
2. Click **Send Test**
3. Select the event type to simulate
4. Check that your endpoint received the request

### Retry policy

Failed webhook deliveries are retried with exponential backoff:

- Attempt 1: Immediate
- Attempt 2: 1 minute
- Attempt 3: 5 minutes
- Attempt 4: 30 minutes
- Attempt 5: 2 hours

After all retries fail, the event is logged as undelivered. You can view failed deliveries in the webhook logs and manually retry them.

### Webhook logs

View delivery history for each webhook:

1. Go to webhook detail
2. See **Recent Deliveries**
3. View request payload and response for each attempt
4. Filter by status (success, failed, pending)

## Team management

Manage team access at **Settings > Team**.

### Inviting members

1. Click **Invite Member**
2. Enter email address
3. Click **Send Invite**

The invitee receives an email with a link to join your organization.
