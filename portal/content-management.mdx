The Content section of the Admin Portal provides tools for uploading, organizing, and managing your video library. You can track content through its entire lifecycle, apply editorial controls, and schedule when content appears in your feed.

## Content library

Access your content library at **Content > Library**. The library displays all content in your organization with its current status, metadata, and editorial settings.

### Views

Switch between display modes:

- **Grid view**: Thumbnail previews with quick actions
- **List view**: Detailed table with sortable columns

### Filtering

Filter content by any combination of the following:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Status** | `waiting_for_upload`, `processing`, `ready`, `error`, `archived` |
| **Tags** | Select one or more tags |
| **Date range** | Upload date or publish date |
| **Duration** | Short (less than 30s), Medium (30s-2m), Long (more than 2m) |
| **Editorial** | Pinned, suppressed, scheduled |

### Sorting

Sort content by:
- Upload date (newest/oldest)
- Publish date
- Title (A-Z / Z-A)
- Duration
- Status

### Search

Full-text search across:
- Title
- Description
- Tags
- Custom metadata values

## Content statuses

Every piece of content moves through a defined lifecycle:

| Status | Meaning | Visible in feed? |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `waiting_for_upload` | Upload session created, video file not yet received | No |
| `processing` | Video is being transcoded into streaming formats | No |
| `ready` | Processing complete, available for playback | Yes (if not suppressed, not expired, and past `publish_at`) |
| `error` | Processing failed | No |
| `archived` | Manually archived or expired via `expires_at` | No |

Content only appears in the feed when its status is `ready`, it is not suppressed, the current time is past `publish_at` (if set), and the current time is before `expires_at` (if set).

## Uploading content

### Drag and drop

1. Go to **Content > Upload**
2. Drag video files onto the upload zone, or click to browse your file system
3. Multiple files are supported for bulk upload

### Upload via URL

1. Go to **Content > Upload**
2. Select the **URL** tab
3. Paste the URL of a publicly accessible video file
4. ShortKit downloads and processes the file

### Supported formats

</Tip>

## Editing metadata

### Single content item

1. Click on a content item in the library
2. Edit fields in the detail panel:
   - **Title** (required)
   - **Description**
   - **Tags** (add/remove)
   - **Custom metadata** (key-value pairs passed through to the SDK)
3. Click **Save**

### Bulk editing

1. Select multiple items using checkboxes or Shift+click
2. Click **Bulk Edit** in the toolbar
3. Choose action:
   - Add or remove tags
   - Set expiry date
   - Archive selected items

## Editorial controls

Editorial controls let you override the default feed ordering for specific content items.

### Pin

Force content to a specific position in the feed:

1. Open content detail
2. Go to the **Editorial** tab
3. Enable **Pin**
4. Set position (1 = top of feed)

Pinned items always appear at their assigned position regardless of the default feed ordering. Multiple items can be pinned to different positions.

### Suppress

Remove content from the feed without archiving it:

1. Open content detail
2. Go to the **Editorial** tab
3. Enable **Suppress**

Suppressed content is excluded from the feed entirely. It remains in your library and can be un-suppressed at any time.

### Schedule

Control when content appears in and disappears from the feed:

1. Open content detail
2. Set **Publish at** (`publish_at`) to a future date and time -- content will not appear in the feed until this time
3. Optionally set **Expires at** (`expires_at`) -- content will be automatically archived after this time

| Field | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `publish_at` | Content is held back from the feed until this date/time passes |
| `expires_at` | Content is automatically archived after this date/time |

Both fields are optional. If neither is set, content appears in the feed as soon as it reaches `ready` status and remains there until manually archived.

## Captions

### Auto-generated captions

If auto-captioning is enabled for your organization:
1. Captions are generated automatically during processing
2. Review generated captions in the **Captions** tab of the content detail
3. Download VTT files to edit and re-upload if needed

### Upload captions

1. Open content detail
2. Go to the **Captions** tab
3. Click **Upload Caption Track**
4. Select an SRT or VTT file
5. Set language and label

### Managing tracks

- Add multiple language tracks
- Set the default track for playback
- Delete tracks

## Thumbnails

### Auto-generated

The platform generates thumbnail options automatically:
- First frame
- Several frames sampled from throughout the video

### Custom thumbnail

1. Open content detail
2. Go to the **Thumbnail** tab
3. Select from auto-generated options, or upload a custom image

Requirements for custom thumbnails:
- JPEG or PNG format
- Minimum 1280x720 resolution

## Asset preview

### Video preview

- Play video directly in the portal
- Scrub through content
- View at different quality levels

### Preview assets

View all generated assets for a content item:
- Thumbnails
- Preview GIF
- Caption tracks

## Content with errors

When content fails processing:

1. The status changes to `error`
2. Click the item in the library to view error details
3. Click **Retry** to reprocess the content

Common errors:
- Unsupported codec
- Corrupt file
- Missing audio track

## Archiving and deleting content

### Archiving

Archive content to remove it from the feed while keeping it in your library:

1. Select content
2. Click **Archive**
3. Content is removed from the feed
4. Can be restored by changing status back to `ready`

### Deleting

Permanently delete content and all associated assets:

1. Select content
2. Click **Delete**
