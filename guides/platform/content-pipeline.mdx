ShortKit uses a direct-upload model. Your server creates an upload session, receives a signed URL, and your client uploads the file directly to ShortKit's storage -- no need to proxy video bytes through your own infrastructure.

## Upload flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an upload session">
    Your server calls `POST /v1/uploads` with the content metadata and receives a signed upload URL.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="cURL">
        ```bash
        curl -X POST https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/uploads \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "title": "Breaking: Major Weather Event",
            "description": "Live coverage of the approaching storm system",
            "tags": ["weather", "breaking"],
            "generateSubtitles": true,
            "customMetadata": {
              "articleUrl": "https://example.com/weather/storm",
              "authorId": "author_456"
            }
          }'
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="JavaScript">
        ```javascript
        const response = await fetch("https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/uploads", {
          method: "POST",
          headers: {
            "Authorization": "Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            title: "Breaking: Major Weather Event",
            description: "Live coverage of the approaching storm system",
            tags: ["weather", "breaking"],
            generateSubtitles: true,
            customMetadata: {
              articleUrl: "https://example.com/weather/storm",
              authorId: "author_456"
            }
          })
        });

        const { data } = await response.json();
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Response:

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "id": "sk_content_abc123",
        "uploadUrl": "https://upload.shortkit.dev/direct/abc123...",
        "status": "waiting_for_upload"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload the file to the signed URL">
    The client uploads the video file directly to the signed URL using an HTTP PUT request. The URL is time-limited and single-use.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="cURL">
        ```bash
        curl -X PUT "${uploadUrl}" \
          -H "Content-Type: video/mp4" \
          --data-binary @video.mp4
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="JavaScript">
        ```javascript
        await fetch(data.uploadUrl, {
          method: "PUT",
          headers: { "Content-Type": "video/mp4" },
          body: videoFile
        });
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Processing begins automatically">
    Once the file is received, ShortKit's transcoding pipeline begins processing. The content status transitions from `waiting_for_upload` to `processing`. During this stage, ShortKit generates:

    - HLS adaptive bitrate renditions
    - First-frame thumbnails
    - Caption tracks (if `generateSubtitles` was enabled)

    Processing typically takes **1 -- 2 minutes** for a 30-second video.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Content becomes ready">
    When processing completes, the content status transitions to `ready` and becomes eligible to appear in feeds. You are notified via webhook.

    ```json
    {
      "event": "content.ready",
      "data": {
        "id": "sk_content_abc123",
        "title": "Breaking: Major Weather Event",
        "duration": 32.5,
        "status": "ready"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Content lifecycle

Every piece of content moves through a well-defined state machine:

```
POST /v1/uploads
      |
      v
waiting_for_upload
      |
      |  (file uploaded to signed URL)
      v
  processing
      |
   +--+--+
   |     |
   v     v
 ready  error
   |
   |  (manual archive or expiry)
   v
 archived
```

| Status | Meaning | Visible in feed? |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `waiting_for_upload` | Upload session created; file not yet received | No |
| `processing` | Video is being transcoded and prepared for delivery | No |
| `ready` | Processing complete; playback is available | Yes (subject to scheduling and editorial controls) |
| `error` | Processing failed | No |
| `archived` | Manually archived or expired via `expires_at` | No |

### Polling for status

You can check the current status of an upload at any time:

```bash
curl https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/uploads/sk_content_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key"
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "sk_content_abc123",
    "status": "ready",
    "title": "Breaking: Major Weather Event",
    "duration": 32.5
  }
}
```

## Webhook notifications

ShortKit sends webhook events when content transitions to a terminal processing state.

### content.ready

Fired when transcoding completes successfully and the content is available for playback.

```json
{
  "event": "content.ready",
  "data": {
    "id": "sk_content_abc123",
    "title": "Breaking: Major Weather Event",
    "duration": 32.5,
    "status": "ready"
  }
}
```

### content.errored

Fired when transcoding fails.

```json
{
  "event": "content.errored",
  "data": {
    "id": "sk_content_abc123",
    "status": "error",
    "error": {
      "code": "TRANSCODE_FAILED",
      "message": "Video codec not supported"
    }
  }
}
```

## Metadata

### Required fields

<ResponseField name="title" type="string" required>
  Content title. Displayed in the Admin Portal and available to the SDK via `customMetadata`.
</ResponseField>

### Optional fields

<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
  Content description. Available to the SDK for display or accessibility.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tags" type="string[]">
  Tags for categorization and filtering (e.g., `"sports"`, `"breaking"`).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="generateSubtitles" type="boolean" default="false">
  When `true`, ShortKit automatically generates caption tracks via speech-to-text during processing. See [Transcoding](/guides/platform/transcoding) for details.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="publishAt" type="datetime">
  Scheduled publish time (ISO 8601). Content remains hidden from feeds until this time.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="expiresAt" type="datetime">
  Expiry time (ISO 8601). Content is automatically archived after this time and removed from feeds.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="customMetadata" type="object">
  Arbitrary key-value pairs passed through to the SDK in feed responses. Use this to attach application-specific data to content items.

  Common examples:
  - `articleUrl` -- link to a related article
  - `productId` -- associated product for shoppable video
  - `authorName` -- content creator name
  - `category` -- application-level category identifier
</ResponseField>

### Example with full metadata

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/uploads \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Breaking: Major Weather Event",
    "description": "Live coverage of the approaching storm system",
    "tags": ["weather", "breaking"],
    "generateSubtitles": true,
    "publishAt": "2026-02-05T08:00:00Z",
    "expiresAt": "2026-02-12T00:00:00Z",
    "customMetadata": {
      "articleUrl": "https://example.com/weather/storm",
      "severity": "high",
      "region": "midwest"
    }
  }'
```

## Auto-generated assets

When content reaches `ready` status, ShortKit has automatically generated the following assets:

| Asset | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **HLS renditions** | Multiple quality levels for adaptive bitrate streaming (see [Transcoding](/guides/platform/transcoding)) |
| **First-frame thumbnail** | Static image of the first frame, used by the SDK for instant display before video loads |
| **Caption tracks** | Auto-generated subtitle track embedded in the HLS manifest (when `generateSubtitles: true`) |

Thumbnails and caption tracks are delivered alongside video content in the feed response. The SDK handles them automatically -- no additional integration is required.
