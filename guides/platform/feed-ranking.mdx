ShortKit's Feed Service determines the order in which content appears for each user. The feed combines a default ranking strategy with editorial controls that give your team precise control over what users see.

## Default ranking: reverse-chronological

Content in the feed is ordered by creation time, newest first. This provides a predictable, transparent baseline: the most recently published content always appears at the top.

```
score = created_at DESC
```

Only content that meets all of the following criteria is eligible for the feed:

- Status is `ready`
- Not suppressed (`is_suppressed` is false)
- Current time is past `publish_at` (if set)
- Current time is before `expires_at` (if set)

## Editorial controls

Editorial controls let your team override the default ranking for specific content items. Three controls are available:

### Pin to position

Lock a content item to a specific position in the feed. Pinned items appear at their designated position for all users regardless of creation time.

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/content/sk_content_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pinPosition": 1
  }'
```

<ResponseField name="pinPosition" type="integer">
  The 1-indexed position in the feed where this content should appear. Set to `null` to unpin.

  - Pinned items are served before unpinned items.
  - When multiple items are pinned, they are ordered by their `pinPosition` value (ascending).
  - If two items share the same `pinPosition`, the more recently updated item takes precedence.
</ResponseField>

### Suppress

Hide a content item from the feed entirely. The content remains in the system and can be restored at any time.

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/content/sk_content_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "isSuppressed": true
  }'
```

<ResponseField name="isSuppressed" type="boolean" default="false">
  When `true`, the content is excluded from all feed responses. Set back to `false` to restore it.
</ResponseField>

### Schedule with publish and expiry windows

Control when content appears in and disappears from the feed using time-based scheduling.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/uploads \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Game Day Highlights",
    "publishAt": "2026-02-05T18:00:00Z",
    "expiresAt": "2026-02-06T06:00:00Z"
  }'
```

<ResponseField name="publishAt" type="datetime">
  ISO 8601 timestamp. Content is hidden from feeds until this time, even if its status is `ready`. Omit to publish immediately when processing completes.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="expiresAt" type="datetime">
  ISO 8601 timestamp. Content is automatically removed from feeds and archived after this time. Omit for content that does not expire.
</ResponseField>

### Combined example

Pin a breaking-news video to the top of the feed and set it to expire after 24 hours:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/content/sk_content_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pinPosition": 1,
    "expiresAt": "2026-02-06T12:00:00Z"
  }'
```

## Feed ordering logic

The feed applies editorial controls on top of the default ranking in a deterministic order:

1. **Filter** -- exclude content that is not `ready`, is suppressed, or is outside its publish/expiry window
2. **Pin** -- place pinned items at their designated positions
3. **Rank** -- order remaining (unpinned) items by `created_at` descending
4. **Paginate** -- return the requested page of results

```
Feed response:

  Position 1:  [Pinned]     sk_content_breaking    (pinPosition: 1)
  Position 2:  [Pinned]     sk_content_promo        (pinPosition: 2)
  Position 3:  [Ranked]     sk_content_newest        (created 5 min ago)
  Position 4:  [Ranked]     sk_content_recent        (created 1 hour ago)
  Position 5:  [Ranked]     sk_content_older          (created 3 hours ago)
  ...
```

## Cursor-based pagination

The feed API uses cursor-based pagination to deliver content in pages. This approach provides consistent performance regardless of how deep into the feed the user has scrolled.

### How it works

Each feed response includes a `next_cursor` value in the `meta` object. Pass it back on the next request to fetch the next page.

**First page:**

```bash
curl "https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/feed?limit=10" \
  -H "X-API-Key: pk_live_your_publishable_key"
```

```json
{
  "data": [ ... ],
  "meta": {
    "next_cursor": "eyJjYSI6IjIwMjYtMDItMDUiLCJpZCI6InNrX2NvbnRlbnRfYWJjMTIzIn0="
  }
}
```

**Next page:**

```bash
curl "https://api.shortkit.dev/v1/feed?limit=10&cursor=eyJjYSI6IjIwMjYtMDItMDUiLCJpZCI6InNrX2NvbnRlbnRfYWJjMTIzIn0=" \
  -H "X-API-Key: pk_live_your_publishable_key"
```

When `next_cursor` is `null`, there is no more content available. The SDK handles pagination automatically -- it pre-fetches the next page as the user approaches the end of the currently loaded content.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `limit` | integer | 10 | Number of items per page (max 50) |
| `cursor` | string | -- | Opaque cursor from a previous response |

## Future: signal-weighted ranking

The current reverse-chronological ranking provides a predictable baseline. A future release will introduce signal-weighted ranking that factors in engagement data (watch time, completion rate), content freshness, and user preferences.

The ranking formula will follow this structure:

```
score = w_recency    * recency
      + w_engagement * engagement
      + w_affinity   * topic_affinity
      + w_completion * completion_rate
```

Editorial controls (pin, suppress, schedule) will continue to take precedence over algorithmic ranking.
