ShortKit provides a best-in-class short-form video feed for your app without requiring you to build video infrastructure. A single SDK integration gives you a production-grade feed with adaptive streaming, intelligent prefetch, engagement tracking, and analytics — all behind one API.

## Why ShortKit?

Media companies produce enormous volumes of short-form content but distribute it on platforms they don't control. This creates three structural problems that compound over time:

  <Card title="Attention leakage" icon="eye-slash">
    Users consume your content on third-party platforms. You build their audience, not yours. Every view outside your app is a missed opportunity for direct engagement.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Revenue leakage" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    Short-form video ad revenue accrues to the distribution platform, not to you. Effective monetization requires users in your app, watching your inventory, on your terms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data loss" icon="database">
    Engagement signals — what users watch, skip, rewatch, and share — remain locked inside third-party platforms. Without this data, you cannot improve your product or optimize advertising.

## The ShortKit platform

ShortKit is composed of three components with a single integration surface. The SDK communicates with one API — your application never interacts with the underlying infrastructure directly.

  <Card title="Client SDK" icon="mobile" href="/sdk/overview">
    Native SDKs with full-screen vertical video feeds, adaptive bitrate streaming, intelligent prefetch, engagement tracking, and configurable UI. Zero external dependencies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Video infrastructure" icon="server" href="/guides/platform/content-pipeline">
    Fully managed backend handling upload, transcoding, CDN delivery, feed ranking, remote configuration, engagement analytics, and identity resolution. Scales automatically with no server management required.

  <Card title="Admin portal" icon="browser" href="/portal/overview">
    Web dashboard for content management, feed configuration, A/B testing, analytics, and settings. Enables non-technical team members to manage feeds without code changes.
