shortkit is a full-stack platform that enables media companies, news publishers, and content-driven businesses to deploy native, high-quality short-form video feeds within their own mobile and web applications.

<Note>
  Stop ceding attention and ad revenue to TikTok and Instagram Reels. Own your video experience.
</Note>

## Why shortkit?

Media companies create enormous volumes of content but distribute it primarily on centralized platforms. This creates three structural problems:

  <Card title="Attention leakage" icon="eye-slash">
    Users consume your content but remain on TikTok or Instagram. You build audience for them, not yourself.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Revenue leakage" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    Ad revenue from short-form video accrues to the platform, not you. Your monetization depends on users being in your app.

  <Card title="Data loss" icon="database">
    Engagement signals stay with centralized platforms. You can't use this data to improve your products or sell targeted advertising.

## The shortkit platform

shortkit delivers three tightly integrated components:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Client SDK" icon="mobile" href="/sdk/overview">
    Cross-platform SDK with production-grade vertical video feeds, adaptive bitrate streaming, intelligent prefetch, and extensible UI components.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Video infrastructure" icon="server" href="/infrastructure/overview">
    Managed backend handling upload, transcoding, CDN delivery, feed ranking, analytics, and metadata management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Admin portal" icon="browser" href="/admin-portal/overview">
    Web dashboard for content management, feed configuration, A/B testing, ad integration, and analytics.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## What makes shortkit different

Unlike point solutions that handle only infrastructure or only ranking, shortkit delivers the complete vertical stack as a unified service.

| Capability | shortkit | Mux | Shaped.ai | DIY |
|------------|----------|-----|-----------|-----|
| Video transcoding & CDN | Yes | Yes | No | Build yourself |
| Native player SDKs | Yes | Basic | No | Build yourself |
| Feed ranking | Yes | No | Yes | Build yourself |
| A/B experimentation | Yes | No | No | Build yourself |
| Ad integration | Yes | No | No | Build yourself |
| Admin portal | Yes | Limited | No | Build yourself |

<Tip>
  The value proposition isn't just managed video delivery—it's eliminating $300K+ in developer time required to build a performant, algorithmically-ranked video feed from scratch.
