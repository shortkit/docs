This page explains the fundamental concepts you'll encounter when working with shortkit.

## Organizations

An **organization** represents your company or team in shortkit. Each organization has:

- Isolated content library and user data
- Separate API key pairs (publishable and secret)
- Independent configuration and settings
- Its own Admin Portal access

All API requests and SDK operations are scoped to a single organization, identified by your API key.

## Content

**Content** refers to individual video assets in your library. Each content item includes:

- The video file (transcoded into multiple renditions)
- Metadata (title, description, tags)
- Generated assets (thumbnails, preview GIFs, caption tracks)
- Engagement statistics

### Content lifecycle

Content progresses through these states: `processing` → `ready` → `live` → `archived`. If transcoding fails, content enters the `error` state.

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `processing` | Video is being transcoded and assets generated |
| `ready` | Processing complete, not yet visible in feeds |
| `scheduled` | Set to go live at a future date/time |
| `live` | Visible in feeds and available for playback |
| `archived` | Removed from feeds, still accessible via direct link |
| `error` | Processing failed, requires attention |

## Feeds

A **feed** is a ranked list of content served to users. The feed is personalized based on:

- User engagement history (topics watched, completion rates)
- Content freshness (recency)
- Editorial controls (pins, boosts, suppression)
- Geographic relevance
- Configured ranking weights

## Users and identity

shortkit uses a **two-phase identity model** to track users:

### Phase 1: Anonymous

On first launch, the SDK generates a unique device ID. All engagement events are attributed to this anonymous identifier. This allows:

- Immediate signal collection without user authentication
- Device-level personalization
- Feed ranking that improves from the first session

### Phase 2: Identified

When your app authenticates a user, call `setUserId()` to associate their engagement data with a persistent identifier. This enables:

- Cross-device engagement history
- Personalization that follows users between devices
- User-level analytics and reporting

```swift
// When user logs in
shortkit.setUserId("user_12345")

// When user logs out
shortkit.clearUserId()
```

<Info>
  The user ID should be a unique, persistent string from your system (database ID, UUID, hashed email). shortkit never receives or stores actual user credentials.
</Info>

## Configuration

shortkit uses a **hybrid configuration model** combining code-level defaults with server-side overrides:

### Code-level config

Configuration passed during SDK initialization. This defines baseline behavior and serves as the fallback when the server is unreachable.

```typescript
shortkit.initialize({
  apiKey: 'pk_live_...',
  config: {
    feedOrientation: 'vertical',
    feedHeight: 'fullscreen',
    controls: { playPause: true, scrubber: true }
  }
});
```

### Remote config overlay

The SDK fetches configuration from the server on initialization. This overlay contains only the fields that differ from your defaults, including any A/B test variant assignments.

Remote config enables you to:
- Change behavior without app updates
- Run A/B experiments
- Adjust settings per user segment

<Tip>
  The SDK never blocks rendering waiting for remote config. If the fetch fails or times out (default: 2 seconds), it falls back gracefully to cached or code-level config.
</Tip>

## Ranking signals

The feed ranking system uses multiple **signals** to determine content order:

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Recency** | How recently the content was published. Newer content scores higher. |
| **Engagement** | Aggregate engagement across all users: views, watch time, completions, shares. |
| **Geo-relevance** | Match between user location and content's geographic targeting. |
| **Topic affinity** | Match between user's historical preferences and content tags. |
| **Completion rate** | How often users watch this content to the end. |

Weights for each signal are configurable in the Admin Portal, allowing you to tune the balance between freshness and engagement.

## Editorial controls

Editorial teams can override algorithmic ranking with three controls:

    Force content to a specific position (e.g., position 1) regardless of ranking score. Deterministic for all users.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Boost" icon="arrow-up">
    Add a positive modifier to ranking score, causing content to rise while still competing with other signals.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Suppress" icon="arrow-down">
    Add a negative modifier or exclude content from the feed entirely.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Adaptive bitrate streaming

shortkit delivers video using **adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming**. Each video is transcoded into multiple quality levels:

| Rendition | Resolution | H.264 Bitrate | AV1 Bitrate |
|-----------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1080p | 1920×1080 | ~4,500 kbps | ~2,500 kbps |
| 720p | 1280×720 | ~2,500 kbps | ~1,500 kbps |
| 480p | 854×480 | ~1,200 kbps | ~700 kbps |
| 360p | 640×360 | ~700 kbps | ~400 kbps |
| 240p | 426×240 | ~400 kbps | ~250 kbps |

The SDK automatically selects the optimal quality based on:
- Available network bandwidth
- Device capabilities
- Battery state

This ensures smooth playback across varying network conditions while maximizing quality when bandwidth allows.

## Engagement events

The SDK collects **engagement events** to power analytics and feed ranking:

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `impression` | Video enters viewport |
| `playStart` | First frame begins playback |
| `watchProgress` | Periodic updates during playback |
| `completion` | Video reaches end |
| `swipe` | User navigates to next/previous video |
| `interaction` | User taps a control (share, like, etc.) |

Events are batched and sent at regular intervals (default: every 5 seconds) to minimize network overhead.

## Webhooks

**Webhooks** notify your server when important events occur in shortkit:

- `content.ready` - Content finished processing and is available
- `content.errored` - Content processing failed

Webhook requests include a signature header (`X-Shortform-Signature`) for verification.
